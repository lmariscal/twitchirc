## Light-TwitchIRC
This is a modfied version of this Library, I was getting complains and I was experimenting some lag after a long time of usage with the bot, that is because it generates a new Object per User and stores it, it is usefull for short time periods of usage but fatal for a 24/7 bot, so this is a much better version and lighter It is used the same and has the same features excepting the User|Channel object.
